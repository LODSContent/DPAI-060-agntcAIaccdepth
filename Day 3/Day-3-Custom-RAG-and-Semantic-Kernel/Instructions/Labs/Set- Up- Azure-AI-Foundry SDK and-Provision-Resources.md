# Exercise 1: Set Up Azure AI Foundry SDK and Provision Resources 

In this exercise, you will set up the Azure AI Foundry SDK. This includes configuring the environment, deploying foundation models, and ensuring seamless integration with Azure AI services for knowledge retrieval and inference.

### Task 1: Install the requirements for the Project

In this task, you will clone the GitHub repository for the project to access the necessary files for building the chat app.

1. On your **Lab VM**, launch **Visual Studio Code**.

1. Click on **File (1)**, then **Open Folder**.

1. Navigate to `C:\LabFiles\Day-3-Custom-RAG-and-Semantic-Kernel` **(1)**, select the **Custom-RAG-App (2)** folder and then click on **Select folder (3)**.

1. Click on **Yes, I trust the author**.

      >**Note:** Wait for the installation to complete. It might take some time.


### Task 2: Configure Environment Variables

In this task, you will set up and configure the necessary environment variables to ensure seamless integration between your RAG application and Azure AI Foundry services.

1. Open a new tab in the browser and navigate to Azure AI Foundry portal using below link

   ```
    https://ai.azure.com/
   ```

1. Click on the **Azure AI Foundry** Icon on top left.
1. Select the AI foundry project that you created earlier in the lab i.e. **ai-foundry-project-<inject key="Deployment ID" enableCopy="false"></inject> (1)**
1. Navigate to your **Overview (1)** page of **ai-foundry-project-<inject key="Deployment ID" enableCopy="false"></inject>** and then copy and paste the **Project connection string (2)** in a notepad. You will be using it in the next step.

1. Get back to **Visual Studio Code**.

1. Right-click on **.env.sample (1)** and select **Rename (2)**.

    ![](../media/af29.png)

1. Rename the file to `.env`.

1. Click on the `.env` file and update the following values in the file

    - Replace **your_connection_string** with the **Project connection string** you copied in Step 2.
    - CHAT_MODEL="gpt-4o"
    - EVALUATION_MODEL="gpt-4o"
    - INTENT_MAPPING_MODEL="gpt-4o"

1. Press **Ctrl+S** to save the file.

### Review

This exercise guided participants through setting up a project in Azure AI Foundry, deploying and managing AI models, and creating an Azure AI Search service for efficient data retrieval. They integrated the search service with their project, cloned a GitHub repository containing necessary resources, and configured environment variables to ensure seamless execution.

In this exercise, you have accomplished the following:
- Task 1: Install the requirements for the Project
- Task 2: Configure Environment Variables

### You have successfully finished the exercise. Click **Next** to continue to the next exercise.
