# Hands-on Labs - Day 2

# Azure AI Agents

### Overall Estimated Duration: 4 Hours

## Overview

This hands-on lab offers a comprehensive introduction to building AI agents using the Azure AI Agent Service SDK. You will begin by creating AI agents with the Azure AI Agent Service. Throughout the lab, you will explore techniques for agent collaboration, automation, and task execution. By the end of this experience, you will have hands-on expertise in designing, deploying, and managing AI agents to build intelligent, scalable, and efficient AI-driven applications.

## Objective 

By the end of this lab, you will be able to:

- **Set Up AI Project and Perform Chat Completion from VS Code:** This hands-on lab will guide you through setting up the environment for building AI Agents. You will begin by configuring an AI Project in Azure AI Foundry, deploying a Large Language Model (LLM) and embedding models. Next, you will connect Visual Studio Code to the AI Project and perform a chat completion call to validate the setup, ensuring seamless integration and functionality.

- **Build a Simple AI Agent:** In this hands-on lab, you will be introduced to AI Agents in Azure and learn how to build a simple AI Agent. You will create an agent that generates a bar chart comparing health benefit plans, leveraging AI capabilities to process data and visualize insights effectively.

- **Develop a Multi-Agent System:** In this hands-on exercise, you will build a multi-agent system where four AI Agents collaborate to generate reports on health plan documents. You will create a Search Agent to retrieve policy information from Azure AI Search, a Report Agent to generate detailed reports, a Validation Agent to ensure compliance with specified requirements, and an Orchestrator Agent to manage communication between all agents. This lab will provide practical experience in designing and coordinating AI agents for complex tasks.

## Prerequisites

Participants should have:

- **Visual Studio Code (VS Code):** Proficiency in using Visual Studio Code for coding, debugging, and managing extensions for various programming languages and frameworks.
- **Development Skills:** Basic programming knowledge in Python or JavaScript, experience with APIs, SDKs, and working in Visual Studio Code.
- **Azure AI & Cloud Concepts:** Understanding of Azure AI Foundry, AI Agent development, deploying LLMs and embedding models, and working with Azure AI Search for vector-based retrieval.
- **AI & Data Processing:** Knowledge of prompt engineering, chat completion workflows, embedding models, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and content filtering techniques.
- **System Design & Multi-Agent Coordination:** Understanding AI agent architectures, designing retrieval, validation, and orchestration agents, and coordinating multi-agent interactions.

## Explanation of Components

- **Azure AI Foundry:** A cloud-based platform for developing, deploying, and managing AI models. It allows users to configure AI projects, deploy Large Language Models (LLMs), and integrate embedding models to enhance AI applications.
- **Azure AI Hub**: A core component of Azure AI Foundry, is a top-level Azure resource that provides a central, secure, and collaborative environment for teams to build, manage, and deploy AI applications, offering access to various Azure AI services with a single setup. 
- **Azure AI Search:** A vector-based search service that enables Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) by indexing and retrieving relevant documents to improve AI-generated responses.
- **Azure AI Services**: A collection of cloud-based AI services that allow developers and data scientists to build intelligent applications, offering pre-built and customizable APIs and models for tasks like speech, vision, language, and knowledge
- **Azure Key Vault**: It is cloud service that securely stores and manages secrets, certificates, and cryptographic keys, allowing authorized users and applications to access them while enhancing security and reducing data breach risks. 
- **LLMs and Embeddings:** Understanding Large Language Models (LLMs), their capabilities, and how embeddings are used for text similarity, search, and knowledge retrieval in AI applications.
